# galo-multiplayer
Multiplayer version of the galo game. Can scale to N players each one with his own symbol. Grid grows as players increase.

Serverless, same stack as [forca-multiplayer](https://github.com/6135/forca-multiplayer): React on GitHub
Pages, all state exchanged over a public MQTT broker, every payload AES-GCM sealed with a key derived from
the room key. No backend, no database.

## Rules

- One player hosts a room with a name and a key. Others join with the same pair, or pick it from the open list.
- 2 to 12 players. The host draws a frozen random order at the start. The seat gives the symbol:
  `X O △ □ ★ ◆ ♣ ♥ ☀ ♠ ☾ ✚`.
- The grid is `(players + 1)²`: 2 players play 3×3, 3 players 4×4, 12 players 13×13.
- The host sets how many marks in a row win (3 to 6, never more than the grid side). Default 3.
- Turns follow the order. Each round the next seat opens. A win scores 1 point. A full grid is a draw.
- A player on turn who drops gets 15 s to come back, then the turn passes.

## Bots (single player)

- The host can add bots in the lobby, with or without other people in the room. No bot exists until the host
  adds one. A host alone plus one bot is a single player game.
- A bot takes a seat, a symbol and a score like a person, and makes the grid grow the same way.
- Bots run on the host device, in a Web Worker. Nothing new travels on the wire: a bot move goes through the
  same host reducer as a human move.
- The AI (`src/game/ai/mcts.ts`) is a port of the Monte Carlo Tree Search from
  [IA-Mini-Project-Tict-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/6135/IA-Mini-Project-Tict-Tac-Toe): UCB1 with c = 0.9,
  expansion kept to the winning children when one exists, every child simulated, a heavy playout (win, else
  block, else random), 1 for a win and 0.5 for a draw, a move that lets the next player win at once is pruned,
  and the final pick is the best win ratio. It is extended to an n×n grid, k in a row and N players (each node
  scores for the player that moved into it).
- For large grids (`src/game/ai/tactics.ts`, `src/game/ai/heuristic.ts`):
  - A tactics layer runs before the search: win now, block a win (nearest player in turn order first), make a
    fork, block a fork. A fork needs one winning cell per other player, because each of them can block one.
    Against two fork cells the bot first looks for a forcing threat whose reply gives no fork.
  - A window heuristic (every run of k cells, live for one seat only) ranks the moves. The search opens the
    best moves first and more as visits grow (progressive widening), with a fading bonus for good moves
    (progressive bias). Playouts pick cells by the heuristic, and a playout cut at the depth cap is scored by it.
  - On a grid larger than 4×4 each iteration simulates one new node and expands a node only after its first
    visit (standard MCTS), so the search goes deeper. 3×3 and 4×4 keep the original "simulate every child".
  - The worker keeps the tree of each bot for the round. On the next turn the search starts from the node of
    the new position, with its visits, when the moves in between are on the tree.
- Levels: fácil 25 iterations and no fork search, normal 250 (the original default), difícil 3000, each with a
  time cap.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run broker     # optional local broker on ws://127.0.0.1:1884
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run e2e        # three browsers, two rounds, one local broker (set CHROMIUM_PATH if needed)
npm run sniff -- "<room name>" "<room key>" [broker url]
```

Push to `main` builds and publishes `dist` to the `gh-pages` branch (`.github/workflows/main.yml`).

## Where it differs from forca

The transport (`src/net/`) is the forca code with the protocol `galo/v1`. The roles differ, because galo has
no secret word:

| Item | Decision |
|------|----------|
| Authority | The host owns the room **and** the board. There is no round master. |
| Topics | `room`, `roster`, `round` (retained, host only), `move` (players), `join`, `presence/<clientId>`. |
| A move | The player on turn publishes `move {roundId, playerId, cell, expected}`. The host checks it with the pure `roundReducer` and publishes the new `round`. `expected` is the move count the player saw, so a double click or a stale request is refused. |
| Forged moves | The host maps each client identifier to a player identifier from `join`, and refuses a `move` or a `presence` whose publisher does not match. Any player still holds the room key, so this stops mistakes and casual forgery, not a determined player. |
| Late join | Refused after the start, because the order and the grid are frozen. A known player can reload and rejoin. |
